# **1. Project Overview**

**Goaluxe** is a customizable goal and reward system designed to help users set personal goals, track their progress, and reward themselves upon achieving their targets. The platform combines gamification, AI-driven insights, and social features to motivate users and foster a sense of accomplishment.

### **Technology Stack**

- **Backend**:

  - Modern JavaScript (ES6+ with ES modules)
  - Express.js for the server framework
  - MongoDB (managed via MongoDB Atlas) for the database
  - Layered architecture (Controllers, Services, Models) for maintainability
  - Adherence to SOLID principles for scalability and clean code

- **Frontend**:
  - Next.js 14 for server-side rendering and static generation
  - **shadcn** for reusable, accessible UI components
  - **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
  - **Lucide icons** for a clean and consistent iconography

# **2. Core Functionalities**

### **1. Secure User Registration and Login**

1. **User Registration**

   - Users can securely register by providing a unique username, valid email address, and a strong password.
   - Passwords are encrypted using **bcrypt** or **Argon2** for secure storage.
   - Email verification is required to activate the account, ensuring authenticity and reducing fake accounts.

2. **User Login**
   - Users log in using their registered credentials (username/email and password).
   - Upon successful authentication, users receive a secure **JSON Web Token (JWT)** for accessing protected features.
   - Tokens have an expiration time (e.g., 24 hours) and can be refreshed using a refresh token mechanism.
   - Implement rate limiting and CAPTCHA to prevent brute-force attacks.

### **2. Personal User Profiles with View and Update Options**

1. **Profile Viewing**

   - Users can view their personal profile, which includes:
     - Username
     - Email address
     - Profile picture (with support for image uploads)
     - Activity history (e.g., goals completed, rewards earned)

2. **Profile Updates**

   - Users can update their profile information, such as email, profile picture, or bio.
   - Role-based restrictions ensure users cannot modify their assigned role (e.g., user, admin).

3. **Password Management**
   - Users can change their password by verifying their current password.
   - Password reset functionality is available via email, with a secure token-based flow.

     - Category (e.g., personal, professional, health)
   - Goals can be marked as public or private (visible only to the user).

2. **Goal Listing**

   - Users can view a list of all their goals, sorted by:
     - Status (e.g., active, completed, overdue)
     - Due date (ascending or descending)
   - Goals can be filtered by category, status, or reward type.

3. **Goal Updates and Deletion**
   - Users can edit or delete only the goals they have created.
   - Deletion requires confirmation to prevent accidental removal.

### **7. Break Goals into Subtasks**

1. **Subtasks Creation**

   - Users can divide larger goals into smaller, actionable subtasks.
   - Subtasks can include:
     - Title
     - Description
     - Due date (optional)
     - Completion status (e.g., pending, in progress, completed)

2. **Progress Tracking**
   - Subtask completion contributes to the overall progress of the parent goal.
   - Users can view progress as a percentage or checklist.

---

### **8. Calendar Integration with Goal Reminders**

1. **Calendar Sync**

   - Users can sync their goals and subtasks with external calendars (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook).
   - Integration is done via APIs (e.g., Google Calendar API).

2. **Reminders and Notifications**
   - Users receive reminders for upcoming deadlines via:
     - Email
     - Push notifications (via service workers)
     - In-app alerts
   - Notifications can be customized based on user preferences (e.g., frequency, type).

---

### **9. Gamification Elements**

1. **Points and Badges**

   - Users earn points for completing goals and subtasks.
   - Badges are awarded for milestones, consistency, or special achievements.

2. **Leaderboard**
   - A public or private leaderboard showcases top-performing users based on points earned.
   - Leaderboard rankings can be filtered by time period (e.g., weekly, monthly).

### **10. Social Sharing and Community Challenges**

1. **Achievement Sharing**

   - Users can share their completed goals and badges on social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook).

2. **Community Challenges**
   - Users can join or create community-wide challenges to compete with others.
   - Challenges can have themes, time limits, and collective rewards.

---

### **11. Progress and Analytics Dashboard**

   - Users can view their progress through visual metrics such as charts and graphs.

2. **Goal Statistics**

   - The dashboard displays key statistics, including:
     - Number of goals completed

     - Reward utilization history

3. **Insights and Trends**
   - Users can analyze their performance trends over time to identify areas for improvement.

---

### **12. AI-Powered Personalized Recommendations**

1. **Behavior Analysis**

   - The system uses AI to analyze user behavior, goal completion patterns, and reward preferences.

2. **Personalized Feedback**

   - Users receive tailored suggestions for setting realistic goals, selecting motivating rewards, and improving productivity.

3. **Motivational Tips**
   - AI provides motivational tips based on past achievements, challenges, and user preferences.

2. **Offline Access**
   - Users can access certain features offline, with data syncing automatically once connectivity is restored.

---

### **Additional Considerations**

- **Security**:

  - Implement HTTPS for secure communication.
  - Use CORS policies to restrict unauthorized access.
  - Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities.

- **Scalability**:

  - Use caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data.
  - Implement pagination for large datasets (e.g., goal lists).

- **User Experience**:
  - Provide tooltips and onboarding tutorials for new users.
  - Use animations and micro-interactions to enhance engagement.
